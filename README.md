# Final-Project - Process Scheduler System
![Design preview for the Frontpage section of Process Scheduler System](/image/Process_Scheduler_Preview.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for checking out our final project in Operating System

**To use this system, you need a basic understanding of process scheduling algorithm to provide a valuable opportunity to apply and reinforce your comprehension of these algorithms in a practical setting.**

## Objective 
The Process Scheduler System is designed to  to offer users a hands-on platform for experimenting with and gaining insights into various process scheduling algorithms. By providing a user-friendly environment, we aim to enhance users' understanding of scheduling strategies, such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Non-Preemptive Priority (NPP), and Preemptive Priority (PP).

## How to Use:
When you open the system, you will be confront by the welcome form. And when you continue or click the next button, it will displayed the list of process scheduling algorithms and you will proceed in choosing the algorithm of your choice.

Here are the available algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS) - For FCFS, you'll need to input the arrival times and burst times for each process. Arrival times determine the order of process execution, and burst times represent the duration each process requires for completion. Enter these values to simulate the sequential execution of processes based on both arrival order and execution time.

- Non-Preemptive (NPP) - NPP requires input for priority levels and burst times for each process. Priority levels determine the execution order, and burst times indicate the time needed for each process. Input these values to simulate the non-preemptive execution of processes based on their priority levels and execution time.

- Preemptive (PP) - Similar to NPP, PP necessitates priority levels and burst times for each process. Priority levels establish the execution order, while burst times signify the time required for each process. Input these values to simulate the preemptive execution of processes, allowing higher-priority processes to interrupt lower-priority ones dynamically.

## Outputs
The game provides you with three attempts for each question. If you answer correctly on your first try, you'll receive a (1) point for that question. However, if your initial attempt is incorrect, you can try twice more to get the correct answer. Keep in mind that you will not lose points for wrong answers, but multiple attempts may affect your final score.

**Datagrid Display:**</br>
- Upon clicking the compute button, the computed results will be presented in a datagrid.

**Scrolling Down:** </br>
- To view additional information, scroll down within the datagrid.

**Results Section:** </br>
- Below the datagrid, a results section provides a concise summary of key metrics, including process ID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, waiting time, and priority (for preemptive and non-preemptive algorithms).


**TAKE NOTE** </br>
Always provide the same number of values for arrival time, burst time, and priority (if applicable). Values should be separated by spaces.
By following these instructions and notes, you(users) can effectively simulate and analyze various process scheduling algorithms, ensuring a consistent and accurate input format.
